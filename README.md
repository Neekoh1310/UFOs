# UFOs

## Project Overview
In this project, I was tasked to visualize data on UFO sightings. Using JavaScript, the source file for the data was read and the following three functions were executed:

1. Data was read to build tables.
2. Data was read and filtered.
3. Data was read and the table built was filtered.

Additionally, user experience was enhanced by allowing them to filter UFO sightings based on date, location (city, state and country), and shape. This adds to the functionality and user friendliness of the website.

## Resources
