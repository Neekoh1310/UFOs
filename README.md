# UFOs

## Project Overview
In this project, I was tasked to visualize data on UFO sightings. Using JavaScript, the source file for the data was read and the following three functions were executed:

1. Data was read to build tables.
2. Data was read and filtered.
3. Data was read and the table built was filtered.

Additionally, user experience was enhanced by allowing them to filter UFO sightings based on date, location (city, state and country), and shape. This adds to the functionality and user friendliness of the website.

## Resources
- Data Source: data.js
- Software: Visual Studio Code, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

## Summary and Results
# How to use the UFO Finder website

1. On the top left part of the screen, click on "UFO Sightings" to refresh the page.
2. Filter the results by filling out the "Enter Date", "Enter City", "Enter State", "Enter Country", and "Enter Shape" tabs.
  - Enter Date in "m/dd/yyyy" format
  - Enter City in lower case format (example: los angeles)
  - Enter State in lower case two letter format (example: ca)
  - Enter Country in lower case format (example: us)
  - Enter Shape in lower case format (example: circle)
3. Press "Enter" when all filters are filled out. Note: Pressing "Enter" after filling out a "Filter Search" tab will result in a premature filter search.

# Limitations and Drawbacks

The UFO Finder website is a good basic platform for filtering data to search for UFO sightings. The functionality of the filter tabs is basic, but can be improved.
Some drawbacks and improvements on these drawbacks that I would suggest are the following: 

1. The "UFO Sightings" button is located in a very awkward position (top left of the page) and is not user intuitive. I would suggest moving this right under the Filter Search tabs and make the "Refresh Button" more obvious.
2. The filters themselves need to be filtered better. A syntax error can be easily obtained since the user does not have any instructions on how to properly write out the syntax formats. I would suggest having a drop down menu on each filter options, and even a calendar pop-up on the "Enter Date" section to make the filter process more intuitive. 
3. The data itself can be expanded. The "Enter Country" filter only has one choice (us). 
4. Additional filters for the "Duration" and "Comments" can be added.
